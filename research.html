        <span class="paper-title">Marginal Utility Shocks and the Precautionary Saving Puzzle </span>
        <p><em>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mechanism linking wealth accumulation to shocks in
marginal utility rather than income alone. In contrast to the Bewley–Aiyagari–Huggett
(BAH) framework, where savings eventually decline with wealth, I show that when
households face idiosyncratic longevity shocks that alter the continuation value of utility, saving can remain strictly positive above some threshold. The model predicts that
maintaining marginal utility becomes a luxury relative to consumption, inducing precautionary saving even among the wealthy. Using Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
data on U.S. couples aged 55–65, I document that saving and saving rates rise with
wealth, contrary to BAH predictions. Calibrating the model with health and income
transitions, I find that the mechanism accounts for more than one-quarter of observed
average savings. The results imply that precautionary motives, rather than bequest or
return heterogeneity, drive much of the saving behavior at the top of the wealth distribution.</em> ...</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  <em>This paper imputes total medical spending for the Health 
      and Retirement Survey (HRS) using the Medical Expenditure 
      Survey (MEPS) and discusses moment consistency of the imputated health expenditure. 
      The main theorem proves that, under classical assumptions, OLS estimates remain consistent when using the imputed dependent variable.</em></p>

    <div class="paper-details" style="display:none;">
    <p><strong>Abstract: This paper studies saving patterns among U.S.\ households aged 55--65. We document that for singles, both saving levels and saving rates decline with net worth, while this pattern is absent for couples. Singles also exhibit greater heterogeneity in saving behavior than couples. At the top of the distribution, couple households combine higher wealth with higher returns on wealth. Finally, consistent with recent evidence on saving patterns, we show that standard income fluctuation models fail to explain saving behavior at the top.</strong>  ... </p>
